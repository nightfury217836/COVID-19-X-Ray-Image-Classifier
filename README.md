ðŸ’¡ Ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence can detect COVID-19 just from a chest X-ray? ðŸ©»
In this video, Iâ€™ll show you how I built a COVID-19 X-Ray Image Classifier using Python, TensorFlow, and Computer Vision â€” a complete AI project that predicts infections from medical images. ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥

Weâ€™ll go step by step:
âœ… Loading and preprocessing X-ray image datasets
âœ… Training a Deep Learning model (EfficientNetV2-B0)
âœ… Classifying COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia cases
âœ… Building a beautiful GUI for image upload & prediction
âœ… Displaying class label and model confidence in real-time ðŸŽ¯

This is a full End-to-End Deep Learning Project â€” perfect for students, developers, or anyone adding an AI + Healthcare + Computer Vision project to their portfolio.

âœ¨ By the end, youâ€™ll learn how to:
â€¢ Preprocess medical image datasets for classification
â€¢ Build and train CNNs for medical imaging tasks
â€¢ Use TensorFlow for image prediction
â€¢ Create an interactive GUI for AI-powered healthcare apps

ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Tkinter, Deep Learning

ðŸ’¬ If youâ€™re starting in AI/ML, this tutorial shows how AI can make a real difference in healthcare applications.
